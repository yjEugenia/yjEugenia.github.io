# 👋 About Me

I am Yujing Wang (王誉静), a second-year master student at School of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University, advised by [Prof. Hainan Zhang](https://zhanghainan.github.io/). I received my Bachelor’s degree in School of Mathematical Sciences, Beihang University ([BUAA](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/)).

My research focuses on the intersection of natural language generation and privacy-preseving computation, specifically the following topic:

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG),
- Natural Language Processing (NLP),
- Multimodal Information Retrieval,
- LLM safety.
